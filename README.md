A browser API compatibility database

## Goals
* Automate browser compatibility testing of APIs
* Be a drop-in replacement for [caniuse-db](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse)
* Provide a node API for finding compatibility records

## Installation
```bash
npm install compat-db
```

## Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amilajack/compat-db.git
cd compat-db
yarn

# Create your `.env` file
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure to add your saucelabs keys to your `.env` file ‚ö†Ô∏è
cp .env.example .env

# Migrate the sqlite (the default) or mysql database
yarn migrate

# Build the compatibility database to ./lib/all.json
# üí° You can limit the amount of tests that you run by setting the following ENV's
# PROVIDERS_INDEX_START=0 PROVIDERS_INDEX_END=10 in your `.env` to run the first
# 10 tests
yarn build-compat-db

# Run all tests
yarn test

# If you want to run tests on your local chrome canary installation, install
# and start selenium server. Note that you will need Java to run this üò¢
yarn global add selenium-standalone@latest
selenium-standalone install
selenium-standalone start

# Serve the front-end browser UI for compat-db
yarn view-compat-db
```
